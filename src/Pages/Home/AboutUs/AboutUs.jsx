            At present, the demand for the resale market in our country is
            increasing day by day. We often find that most people after buying a
            product, want to exchange that product after using it for some time,
            exchange their old product with a new product, so the resale market
            is a good way. on the other hand, a resale market is also a good
            option for those who cannot buy new products due to money problems.
            Because they get the product of their choice at a relatively low
            price
